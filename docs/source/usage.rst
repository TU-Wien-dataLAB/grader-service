After installation and configuration of the grader labextension and service you should
be able to access the frontend interface of the extension.
The labextension consists of two launchers.
The assignment launcher opens a window where students can pull and submit their
given assignments.
The course management launcher opens a dashboard
for instructors where you can add, edit and delete assignments.
The course management launcher is only visible if the current user is at least
tutor in one lecture.
