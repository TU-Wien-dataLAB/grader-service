# What is Grader Service?

<!-- TODO: what is grader service? when should it be used? (what are the use cases -> to what can it scale) 
    what does it replace? what does it not replace? -->


The Grader Service is a JupyterLab extension designed for seamless integration in school or university courses, offering instructors an efficient way to create and grade assignments. For students, it provides the convenience of working in the same environment where they receive their scores and can view detailed feedback once assignments are completed.


## As instructor
Grader Service allows you to choose different grading modes: whether you just want an environment that lets you collect student submissions and manually grade them, or fully automate the grading process and let Grader Service handle it for you. You can also combine both options, with some automated tests and exercises within assignments that you prefer to grade manually.

## Grader Service at TU Wien

The Grader Service is an important component of the ðŸ”Ž [TU Wien dataLAB](https://colab.tuwien.ac.at/display/DLJAAS/dataLAB+Jupyter+as+a+Service) project. The dataLAB team offers lecturers at TU Wien the opportunity to seamlessly integrate a JupyterHub instance into their TUWEL spaces. 

This service simplifies the process for instructors, eliminating the need for complex TUWEL configurations. Students can access their assignments directly through a link provided in TUWEL, allowing them to start working immediatelyâ€”completely online and without the need to install resource-intensive software. dataLAB ensures that students have access to the necessary computational resources to complete their tasks effectively.

If you are a lecturer at TU Wien and would like to request a JupyterHub instance, please do so ðŸ“Œ [here](https://colab.tuwien.ac.at/display/DLJAAS/Request+a+JupyterHub).
